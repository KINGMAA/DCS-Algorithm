# Distribution Counting Sort Algorithm

This repository presents a custom **Distribution Counting Sort Algorithm** designed for efficient sorting with detailed analysis and explanation.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project introduces a specialized sorting algorithm inspired by counting sort principles but optimized for improved distribution handling. The repository includes:

- 📄 **PDF Report**: Detailed explanation of the algorithm, code implementation, and complexity analysis.
- 🎥 **YouTube Video**: Visual explanation for better understanding of the algorithm's concepts and logic.

## 📂 Files Included

- Comprehensive report with code, theory, and analysis.
- **YouTube Video Link**: [Watch Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dobY4NTbtiw&t=56s)

## 🚀 How It Works

The Distribution Counting Sort algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Identify the Value Range**: Identify the minimum and maximum values in the dataset.
2. **Distribution Array Creation**: Allocate an array to store the frequency distribution.
3. **Cumulative Distribution Calculation**: Accumulate the counts to determine element positions.
4. **Element Placement**: Place each element in its correct position within the sorted array.

## 📈 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n + k)` where `n` is the number of elements and `k` is the range of values.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(k)` for the distribution array.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/distribution-counting-sort.git
   ```
2. Open the **PDF** for detailed insights and implementation steps.
3. Watch the **YouTube Video** for an in-depth explanation.
